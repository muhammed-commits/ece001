    <td>REACTIVE MACHINES</td>
    <td>The most basic types of AI systems are purely reactive, and have the ability neither to form memories nor to use past experiences to inform current decisions. Deep Blue, IBM’s chess-playing supercomputer, which beat international grandmaster Garry Kasparov in the late 1990s, is the perfect example of this type of machine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LIMITED MEMORY</td>
    <td>This Type II class contains machines can look into the past. Self-driving cars do some of this already. For example, they observe other cars’ speed and direction. That can’t be done in a just one moment, but rather requires identifying specific objects and monitoring them over time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>THEORY OF MIND</td>
    <td>Machines in the next, more advanced, class not only form representations about the world, but also about other agents or entities in the world. In psychology, this is called “theory of mind” – the understanding that people, creatures and objects in the world can have thoughts and emotions that affect their own behavior.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SELF-AWARENESS</td>
    <td>The final step of AI development is to build systems that can form representations about themselves. Ultimately, we AI researchers will have to not only understand consciousness, but build machines that have it.</td>
